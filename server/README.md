# Flywire Interview Exercise

> Create an application to act as a web service for managing and retrieving company employee information. Please use any frameworks and libraries you feel comfortable with and would make sense for the situation. The application uses Spring Boot framework and Apache Tomcat to run the app locally. The data.json file will be the data source used to. If you would like to convert the JSON file into a different database respository, feel free. This base project should provide everything needed to start the web service application.

> All http requests must return a JSON response.

<b>Once you are ready to submit your code, please either create a repo or a zip file.<br/>Name it: "{your-last-name}-flywire-exercise"<b>

1.  Create an http request endpoint that returns a list of all active employees in alphabetical order of last name.

2.  Create an http request endpoint that takes in an ID and returns a JSON response of the matching employees, as well as the names of their direct hires. Employee IDs are unique.
